You can use it to track the link of the current tab you have or add your own input to it, it is useful for a salesperson tracking leads or perhaps someone who wants to create a temporary reading list without the hassle of using bookmarks

I got the idea for this extension from Scrimba's course, however that was built using Vanilla JS & you couldn't delete each link individually. I wanted to practice my React skills so I challenged myself to recreate in React.
