This is a chrome extension built using React that allows you to track leads

You can use it to track the link of the current tab you have or add your own input to it, it is useful for a salesperson tracking leads or perhaps someone who wants to create a temporary reading list without the hassle of using bookmarks

I got the idea for this extension from Scrimba's course, however that was built using Vanilla JS & you couldn't delete each link individually.
